1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Meet Ann. She often shops from www.shoppingcart.com.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
She has her information like email ID, address, and credit card details saved on the website

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
to enable a faster and hassle-free shopping experience.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The required information is stored in a server.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
One day, Ann received an email which stated her eligibility for a special discount voucher from shoppingcart.com.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In order to receive the coupon code, she was asked to fill in her shoppingcart.com account credentials.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This didn't seem fishy to her at the time, as she thought it was just an account verification step.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Little did she realize the danger she would be facing.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
She was knocked off her feet when a substantial amount of money was wiped off her account.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How do you think this happened?

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Well, yes, the email she received was fake.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Ann's shoppingcart.com account witnessed unauthorized access from a third party.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This type of attack is known as a cyber attack, and the person who carries it out is called a hacker.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Could Ann have prevented this attack? Indeed, she could have, with the help of cybersecurity.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Cybersecurity involves techniques that help in securing various digital components,

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
networks, data, and computer systems from unauthorized digital access.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There are multiple ways to implement cybersecurity, depending on the kind of network you are connected to

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and the type of cyber attacks you are prone to.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So, let's take a look at the various cyber attacks that Ann could have been exposed to.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
One of the most common types of cyber attacks is a malware attack like Trojan, Adware, and Spyware, to name a few.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Had Ann downloaded any suspicious attachments online,

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
her system could have gotten corrupted by certain malicious viruses embedded within the attachments.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Next is a phishing attack, the type of cyber attack which Ann experienced.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Here, the hacker usually sends fraudulent emails, which appear to be coming from a legitimate source.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This is done to install malware or to steal sensitive data like credit card information and login credentials.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Another type of attack is the man-in-the-middle attack.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Here, the hacker gains access to the information path between Ann's device and the website's server.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The hacker's computer takes over Ann's IP address.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
By doing so, the communication line between Ann and the website is secretly intercepted.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This commonly happens with unsecured Wi-Fi networks and also through malware.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Password attack is one of the easiest ways to hack a system.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Here, Ann's password could have been cracked by using either common passwords or trying all possible alphabetical combinations.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
To prevent future cyber attacks, Ann sought to implement a few cybersecurity practices.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
First, she installed a firewall.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
As the name suggests, it is a virtual wall between Ann's computer and the internet.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Firewalls filter the incoming and outgoing traffic from your device to safeguard your network,

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and they can either be software applications or hardware reinforcements.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Secondly, Ann implemented honeypots.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Just like how flowers attract bees, dummy computer systems called honeypots are used to attract attackers.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
These systems are made to look vulnerable in order to deceive attackers, and this in turn defends the real system.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
In addition to these, she also decided to use unique alphanumeric passwords,

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
anti-virus software, and started avoiding mails from unknown senders.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That was Ann's story.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Cyberattacks are not just confined to individuals, but also to public and private organizations.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The cyberattacks carried out in such places are more deadly, and they result in colossal losses.

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Motives of such attacks are many, starting from tampering with crucial data to monetary gains.

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's have a look at a few of the cyberattacks that companies are subjected to.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Various public sector organizations and large corporations face the Advanced Persistent Threat, APT.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
In this form of attack, hackers gain access to networks for a prolonged period in order to continuously gain confidential information.

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Companies also witness the Denial of Service attack, where networks are flooded with traffic,

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
which in turn leaves legitimate service requests unattended.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
A variant of this is the Distributed Denial of Service, DDoS, attack, when multiple systems are used to launch the attack.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
When a hacker manipulates a standard SQL query in a database-driven website, it is known as a SQL injection attack.

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
By doing so, hackers can view, edit, and delete tables from databases.

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Amidst a plethora of cyberattacks, it is indeed a challenge for organizations with several networks and servers to ensure complete security.

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This is not an easy task, and to help with this, cybersecurity professionals are hired to work on identifying cyber threats and securing a company's network.

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
There are multiple job roles in the field of cybersecurity.

58
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
If hacking fascinates you, then the role of an ethical hacker is something to be explored.

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Such professionals try to explain a network's vulnerabilities, just like how a hacker would do,

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
but only to identify those vulnerabilities and resolve them for protection against an actual cyberattack.

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But if you are looking to design robust security structures, then the role of a security architect is more apt.

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
A Chief Information Security Officer, CISO, plays a crucial role in enterprise security

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and is entrusted with the overall safety of the information in an organization.

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So, here's a question for you. Identify the type of cyberattack where the hacker's system takes over the client's IP address.

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
A. DDoS attack

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
B. Man-in-the-middle attack

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
C. Phishing attack

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
D. Password attack

Three lucky winners will receive Amazon gift vouchers.

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
With the increase in the production of global digital data, it is anticipated that cyberattacks will quadruple in the near future.

72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Organizations are going to need cybersecurity professionals who can prevent these attacks.

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
A career in the field of cybersecurity is lucrative and a very smart decision for professionals now.
